# Python password strength checker

This Python project enables you to assess the strength of your password. 
The assessment involves analyzing the count of letters, numbers, special characters, and whitespace characters present in the provided password, ultimately assigning a score based on these observations.

This is achieved through the utilization of Python's standard library modules, namely string and getpass. 
Leveraging these modules grants access to a comprehensive array of string characters, which facilitates a thorough comparison with the character composition of our password. 
The inclusion of the .getpass() function further enhances security, allowing us to conceal our password during entry.
